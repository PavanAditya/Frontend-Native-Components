## Problem statement

```
Create a component that takes in an Date and renders text that shows how long ago the date was.
The widget should update as time passes and should represent the time as one of the following:

    * just now
    * less than a minute ago
    * n minutes ago
    * n hours ago
    * n days ago
    * n weeks agos
    * n months ago
    * n years ago
```
