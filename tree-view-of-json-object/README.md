# Tree View Of a JSON Object

> A basic tree view of a JSON object is to be displayed with collapsible property displays.

Includes features like:
<br />

- Expand/Collapsible property details view.
<br />

- Shows the entire object in json tree format.
<br />

- Can search for a particular key/value and can find the property in which it is lying (Feature yet to be coded)
<br />

> Regular JSON viewer type display which helps in recreating a display of a JSON object in a more parsed model display
