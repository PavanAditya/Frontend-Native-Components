# Display Cards

> List of cards display used for displaying products, items and many more.

- Cards are displayed with basic sections like image, card title and short card description.
<br />

- Basic styling and shadow for cards are added to make it look appealing, parallax effects and animations aren't added for any great attractive UI.
<br />

- List of cards are loaded and displayed dynamically by fetching data from a local json source object.
<br />

- Pics for the cards are just randow images taken from [Loren Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)
<br />

### Used in many applications(web & native), can be implemented as a part of attraction added to the project.
